# CIS1051_FinalProject

Some adversities I faced include several factors.
  1. Setting up pygame
       I had to use the windows command line to install pygame, but it was difficult because pygame was only allowed through a different python interpereter.
  2. Getting the cat (player) to stay on the same y-coordinate.
       This is because I never put in an update for the cat to regenerate on the same y-ccordinate. Thus meaning, if the player jumped and died at the same time, they would spawn         a bit lower than intended. I fixed this by adding a reset position in th death screen function.
  3. Placing random spikes
      Placing the spikes using random integers was what I was hoping to accomplish, however they kept regenerating too close to the player or too close to each other. I 
      eventually just spaced out the spikes evenly.

Some things I enjoyed during this project include the following.
  1. Watching videos of people coding with pygame
       This helped me understand how syntax would look when using pygame, and it also kept me inspired to keep going.
  2. Picking out backgrounds
       I definitely enjoyed adding the little spice to a simple game with a funny cat and a nice background.
