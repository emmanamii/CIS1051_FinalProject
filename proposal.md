# Proposal
Emma McGrath
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Running man

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to create a game similar to geometry dash. I want to import my own little running man instead of the little shape used in geometry dash. In this game, you have to keep running and jumping over objects/platforms.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using pygame, I want to create a game that allows the user to play using just the space button (or another random button). The user doesn't need to press a run button because the screen will automatically do that, however there are obstacles the user must overcome. Maybe there is a pit they have to jump over or a plank they need to jump onto.  


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

An understanding on how to create a simple game: but also being able to add cool images into the game. I want to figure out how and if I can create a "never ending game" so that the program doesn't stop running until the user dies (in the game).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will be able to have the basics, such as a generic geometry dash game. However, I'd like to think I can figure out how to import my own images into the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I doubt I will be able to complete everything. However, if I can add everything mentioned AND maybe a boss "level" at some point in the game- that would be cool. That or I can add a feature that for every second that the player plays, the faster the game starts to operate.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to research how I can make a game using pygame, how I can easily import images, and how to have a game that continuously runs.
